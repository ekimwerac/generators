In Python, a generator is a special type of iterable, similar to a list or a tuple, but it generates values on the fly using a function with a yield statement. This allows you to iterate over a potentially large sequence of values without creating the entire sequence in memory at once, which can be more memory-efficient.

Here's a simple example to illustrate Python 3 generators:

```python
def square_generator(n):
    for i in range(n):
        yield i * i

# Using the generator in a for loop
for result in square_generator(5):
    print(result)
```

In this example, `square_generator` is a generator function that yields the square of numbers from 0 to `n-1`. When you call `square_generator(5)`, it doesn't actually execute the function immediately. Instead, it returns a generator object.

When you iterate over the generator using a `for` loop, the function is executed one step at a time, and the values are generated and yielded on the fly. This is more memory-efficient compared to creating a list of all the square values at once.

Generators are particularly useful when working with large datasets or when you need to generate an infinite sequence of values.

Remember, the state of the generator function is maintained between each call to `yield`, allowing it to resume execution from where it left off. This is what enables the generator to produce values lazily as needed.

The `next()` function is a built-in Python function that is used to retrieve the next item from an iterator by repeatedly calling its `__next__()` method. It takes two arguments: the iterator to retrieve the next item from and an optional default value that is returned if the iterator is exhausted (i.e., there are no more items).

Here's how you can use `next()` with a generator object:

```python
def count_up_to(limit):
    count = 0
    while count < limit:
        yield count
        count += 1

# Create a generator object
my_generator = count_up_to(5)

# Use next() to retrieve values from the generator
print(next(my_generator))  # Output: 0
print(next(my_generator))  # Output: 1
print(next(my_generator))  # Output: 2
print(next(my_generator))  # Output: 3
print(next(my_generator))  # Output: 4

# If you try to call next() beyond the available values, it raises StopIteration
try:
    print(next(my_generator))  # Raises StopIteration
except StopIteration:
    print("Generator is exhausted.")
```

In this example, `count_up_to` is a generator function that yields numbers starting from 0 up to the specified limit. We create a generator object `my_generator` using this function. The `next()` function is then used to retrieve the next value from the generator each time it is called.

Once the generator is exhausted (i.e., there are no more values to yield), calling `next()` will raise a `StopIteration` exception. This can be caught, as shown in the try-except block, to handle the end of the iteration.

Using `next()` with generators is a way to manually iterate through the values produced by the generator, and it allows you to control the flow of iteration.
